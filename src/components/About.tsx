              Hi, I m Hamza, a web developer from Karachi, Pakistan. I am a student at GIAIC and have developed a strong interest in web development. Currently, I m learning the essentials of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS to create responsive and functional websites. Looking ahead, I plan to dive deeper into frameworks like React and Next.js to enhance my ability to deliver high-quality modern web solutions. My goal is to combine my passion for learning with technical expertise to create efficient, user-friendly digital experiences. Letâ€™s collaborate and bring your ideas to life!
